The body of a young boy was found in Fife shortly before midnight, police said, and they ''strongly believe this to be the body of Mikaeel''. Sources told the BBC that his mother, named locally as Rosdeep, was detained but police have not confirmed this. Mikaeel went missing from his home in Edinburgh on Wednesday. Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham, of Police Scotland, told a press conference that Mikaeel's family had been informed of the recovery of a body and the investigation was continuing. He also thanked rescue teams and the public for their ''fantastic response'' in helping to search for the missing boy. Police had said Mikaeel disappeared from his home in Ferry Gait Crescent at about 21:00 GMT on Wednesday. More than 200 volunteers from the community had joined the emergency services to look for Mikaeel. The body was found in Fife, a region north of Edinburgh across the Firth of Forth, but police have not disclosed where in the area the discovery was made. ACC Graham said: ''The investigation into the disappearance of Mikaeel Kular has been wide ranging and fast moving. ''As a result of these inquiries I can confirm that we have recovered the body of a young boy in Fife shortly before midnight. We have informed the family and the investigation continues. ''A person has been detained in connection with the death. ''I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has shown such a fantastic response to the incident in terms of assisting the police with searches and in terms of our appeals for information and coming forward to assist with information. ''Without such vital assistance the police cannot do their job assisting those who live and work in our communities. ''As a result of this development clearly there will now be no requirement for any further help in relation to searches in the Drylaw area. ''",

        "context": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing higher premiums, less choice and a last-minute advertising pullback, fewer people signed up for coverage this year through HealthCare.gov, according to numbers from a preliminary government report Friday. About 9.2 million people signed up through HealthCare.gov, the insurance website serving most states, said the Health and Human Services Department. That's about 500,000 fewer customers than had enrolled last year in those same 39 states, or slippage of around 5 percent. The report doesn't include figures from 11 states that run their own health insurance markets - including California and New York - so the final national number will be higher. Nonetheless the preliminary report is being closely watched, because President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress have vowed to repeal the Obama-era health law and replace it with a plan that has yet to emerge. The insurance markets created by President Barack Obama's law provide subsidized private coverage for people who don't have access to health care through their jobs. Along with a Medicaid expansion aimed at low-income adults, the Affordable Care Act has helped millions get coverage, reducing the nation's uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent. But even before Trump's election victory, the health insurance markets were facing double-digit premium increases and a sharp drop in insurer participation. Last week the Trump administration pulled back about $5 million in ads that were part of a closing bid to woo the uninsured. Former Obama administration officials immediately cried foul. Trump administration spokesman Matt Lloyd said Friday that ''Obamacare has failed'' and the new president looks forward to providing relief through ''patient-centered solutions that will work for the American people. '' Independent analysts said the report clearly highlights the challenges that Trump and the GOP Congress will face trying to deliver on their promises without disrupting coverage for millions. ''While enrollment is down, this does not exactly paint a picture of a program collapsing,'' said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. ''Enrollment had been tracking on pace with last year, but sign-ups slowed down in the final weeks of open enrollment,'' said Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health. The debate over unwinding the health care law may have contributed, she said. Nonetheless, Pearson said the demand for coverage ''remains strong.'' She added, ''Policymakers will need to consider how forthcoming changes will impact those currently purchasing coverage.'' A final, national enrollment report isn't due until next month. Some of the state-run insurance markets have extended open enrollment through Saturday, although HealthCare.gov's sign-up season ended Jan. 31.",

The 21,600lb (9,800kg) bomb was dropped on a tunnel complex used by so-called Islamic State in Nangarhar province. No civilians were affected by the explosion, the ministry said. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack as ''an inhuman and most brutal misuse of our country''. How powerful is 'mother of all bombs'? The Afghan defence ministry said the bomb struck a village area in the Momand valley where IS fighters were using a network of caves. It said the bomb also destroyed a large stash of weapons. The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb is the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in a conflict. It was dropped by plane in Achin district on Thursday evening local time, the Pentagon said. It is more than 9m (30 ft) in length. It was first tested in 2003, but had not been deployed in combat before. The strike followed last week's death of a US special forces soldier fighting IS in Nangarhar. The news also came hours after the Pentagon admitted an air strike in Syria mistakenly killed 18 rebels. It said a partnered force had mistakenly identified the target location as an IS position, but the strike on 11 April had killed rebels from the Syrian Democratic Forces, which are backed by Washington.",

        "context": "Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are returning to their core themes as they tour the country in a last push for general election votes. On the final day of campaigning before voters go the polls, the PM is promising Brexit will lead to more jobs, homes and better transport links. Mr Corbyn, who will speak at rallies in England, Scotland and Wales, says there are ''24 hours to save the NHS''. Security has dominated the end of the campaign after two terror attacks. Labour has repeatedly criticised cuts to police numbers, while Prime Minister Theresa May promised to change human rights laws if they prevented a crackdown on suspected terrorists. The PM's day starts in London, taking in the South Coast, Norfolk, Nottinghamshire and the West Midlands. Her message focuses on Brexit - the reason she gave for calling Thursday's election 50 days ago - saying money previously spent on EU projects will deliver ''huge benefits'' across the UK. She highlighted the Tories' pledge of a PS23bn National Productivity Investment Fund, focusing on housing, road, rail and broadband improvements. ''A year ago, the British people voted for a brighter future outside the European Union,'' she said. ''My plan to deliver that brighter future will make sure all four corners of our United Kingdom benefit from the opportunities Brexit will bring - with more jobs, more homes, better roads and railways, and world-class digital connectivity wherever you live. '' 'Years of underfunding' Mr Corbyn said the NHS ''cannot afford five more years of underfunding, understaffing and privatisation''. Speaking at a music festival-style rally in Birmingham on Tuesday evening, he said the Conservatives had triggered the general election promising strong and stable government - ''they don't say that very often now, do they? ''They just imagined everything was going to be all over by 8 June,'' he said. ''Well, I tell you what, they underestimated us, didn't they?'' In his final campaign rally in Oxford, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron will urge voters not to give Mrs May a ''blank cheque'', saying the PM has ''spent every day since she called the election trying to avoid answering any questions''. He will repeat his appeal to Labour voters to ''lend'' him their vote in seats where the Lib Dems are the Conservatives' main rival, labelling the Tories ''heartless'' and ''hapless'' over their social care reforms. At their final election rally, the Green Party will call on people to ''vote with their hearts''. ''I'm calling on people across the UK to vote not just for the MP they want, but the kind of country they want,'' co-leader Jonathan Bartley said.",

        "context": "Amnesty International has accused Saudi Arabia of reacting to the Arab Spring by launching a wave of repression. In a report, the human rights group said hundreds of people had been arrested, many of them without charge or trial. Prominent reformists had been given long sentences following trials Amnesty called ''grossly unfair''. So far unrest has largely been confined to the Shia minority in the east of the country. In its 73-page report published on Thursday, Amnesty accuses the Saudi authorities of arresting hundreds of people for demanding political and social reforms or for calling for the release of relatives detained without charge or trial. The report says that since February, when sporadic demonstrations began - in defiance of a permanent national ban on protests - the Saudi government has carried out a crackdown that has included the arrest of mainly Shia Muslims in the restive Eastern Province. Since March, more than 300 people who took part in peaceful protests in Qatif, Ahsa and Awwamiya in the east have been detained, Amnesty says. Most have been released, often after promising not to protest again. Many face travel bans. Anti-terror law Last week 16 men, including nine prominent reformists, were given sentences ranging from five to 30 years in prison. Amnesty said they were blindfolded and handcuffed during their trial, while their lawyer was not allowed to enter the court for the first three sessions. ''Peaceful protesters and supporters of political reform in the country have been targeted for arrest in an attempt to stamp out the kinds of call for reform that have echoed across the region,'' said Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Philip Luther. ''While the arguments used to justify this wide-ranging crackdown may be different, the abusive practices being employed by the Saudi Arabian government are worryingly similar to those which they have long used against people accused of terrorist offences,'' he said. Amnesty says that the government continues to detain thousands of people on terrorism-related grounds. Torture and other ill-treatment in detention are widespread, it says - an allegation Saudi Arabia has always denied. The BBC's Security correspondent Frank Gardner says Saudi Arabia has so far resisted the wave of change that has swept over much of the Arab world. Our correspondent says the kingdom's ageing monarch, King Abdullah, has reacted by releasing billions of dollars into the security and religious establishments, two of the pillars that support his ruling Al-Saud family. Amnesty says the government has drafted an anti-terror law that would effectively criminalise dissent as a ''terrorist crime'' and allow extended detention without charge or trial. Questioning the integrity of the King would carry a minimum prison sentence of 10 years, according to Amnesty.",

        "context": "By Gavin Stamp Political reporter, BBC News A report into the UK's involvement in the Iraq war and its aftermath will not be published this year as had been planned, the inquiry team has said. Sir John Chilcot said he would not report before the middle of 2013 at the earliest - a decade after the war. He said the report would be about a million words long, about twice the size of literary classic War and Peace. Sir John said a ''dialogue'' with government was needed over access to secret documents. Last November, the inquiry said it needed extra time to ''do justice to the issue involved'' and the earliest its conclusions would be handed to the prime minister was this summer. But it has now announced a further delay, which is likely to result in the report not being completed until the end of next year. In its first update on its work for seven months, the inquiry said it had made ''extensive progress'' in drafting its report, but the inquiry was ''unprecedented'' in scope and the issues were ''complex''. The details came in a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, released by the inquiry, from its chairman Sir John. 'Dialogue on documents' On the crucial issue of access to secret documents, Sir John said he hoped to begin a ''dialogue'' with the Cabinet Office later this year about the release of further declassified material. He said ''significant progress'' had been made in obtaining access to important material, but more needed to be done. ''There are a number of particularly important categories of evidence, including the treatment of discussions in Cabinet and Cabinet committees and the UK position in discussions between the prime minister and the heads of state or government of other nations to be addressed,'' he said. The BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera said there had been an ongoing row between the inquiry and the Cabinet Office over certain documents - particularly notes sent by Tony Blair to President Bush and records of their discussions in the run-up to the conflict. Before publication of a final report, letters need to be written to those who have participated, detailing what is being said about them, including any criticism of their conduct. This process, which will take several months, is now thought unlikely to start before the middle of 2013. Hearings The inquiry held 18 months of public hearings between the end of 2009 and early 2011, the last taking place in February 2011. Those giving evidence included former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, senior Cabinet ministers during their governments, military commanders and diplomats. At one hearing in early 2010, inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot expressed his frustration about his committee's inability to publish certain classified documents relating to Iraq policy. Although the committee could see these documents, their public release had not been sanctioned by the government - a move also criticised by Lord Goldsmith, attorney general in the run-up to war. One hundred and seventy-nine British troops were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009, when UK forces left the country.",
